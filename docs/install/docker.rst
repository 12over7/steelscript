SteelScript in a Docker
======================================

SteelScript for Python SDK - includes all of the core SteelScript packages in one simple container. 

Running Notebooks
-----------------

On an environment enabled with Docker, to get started just run:

.. code-block:: bash

	docker run -it riverbed/steelscript


This will pull the latest version and drop you into a bash shell inside a SteelScript workspace. Run the examples or start your own interactive Python session from here.
